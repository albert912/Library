myLibrary[0].book1 to select string not the object.

What if when you clicked remove button you removed the existing books and then rerendered library with display

Do you mean that even if I click just one remove button all the existing books should be removed?

By removed do you mean that they should be deleted from the page or from the library array?

From the page. The only book that should be removed from both page and the library is the one whose remove button is clicked

So, should all books be removed from the page if I click just one remove button?

Well think about it and see if it fixes the index problem
Sorry I gotta run for today
